> About
This script interfaces with the VirusTotal API and is used for uploading a file to their service, which then hashes it and checks it against their own database.

If there are matches to known malware, the vendors and their analysis will be displayed, along with the date this analysis was last updated.

> Usage
./MalwareCheck -i <inputFileName> [-o <outputFileName>]

an input file name must be given, which the script will then upload

the output file name is optional, and if left out the script will print results to the shell.  If a name is given, the script will check for an existing file.
If a file exists, a new file is created with a generic title.  If not, the file is overwritten with the output of the program
